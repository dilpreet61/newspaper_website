            <p>The 18-month long Emergency was proclaimed during the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975.
                Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday hit out at the Congress after the Centre announced that June 25 every year will be marked as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’ against the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi-led Congress government in 1975.
                
                “To observe 25th June as #SamvidhaanHatyaDiwas will serve as a reminder of what happens when the Constitution of India was trampled over. It is also a day to pay homage to each and every person who suffered due to the excesses of the Emergency, a Congress unleashed dark phase of Indian history,” PM Modi posted on social platform X.  </p>

            <p>Wimbledon 2024 Semi Final Live: For the third time in exactly a year, Daniil Medvedev is up against Carlos Alcaraz in a Grand Slam semifinal. In the first, at Wimbledon, the Russian had no answer to the Spaniard's aggressive game style, and he was undone in straight sets. Medvedev's deep court positioning allowed the Spaniard to dominate with his speed and power with the court wide open. The second match, at the US Open, was the exact opposite when Medvedev displayed his tactical genius to beat Alcaraz in four sets. So what can we expect today? "I'll try to make his life difficult," is what Medvedev said on what he needs to do to gain an advantage over the former world no. 1 while stressing the importance of good service games. While Alcaraz will be the favourite going into the match, hoping to extend his head-to-head record to 5-2, what Medvedev does, emotionally and tactically, would dictate the result.

            <p class="news">How did Gautam Gambhir become India's head coach? The story behind his appointment and what happened in BCCI</p>
            <p>The entire back story of Gautam Gambhir's appointment as India head coach: KKR's IPL win hardly mattered; BCCI's focus is on the future.
                With no formal coaching experience—Gautam Gambhir has only worked as a mentor with two IPL franchises—and a professional retirement as late as 2019, how did Gambhir become BCCI's choice as India's new head coach? The popular notion is that his role in helping Kolkata Knight Riders win the IPL after a decade-long wait did the trick. The KKR players and the support staff were vocal about Gambhir's role in creating the perfect team environment. True, but that hardly mattered to the BCCI.
                
                Hindustan Times has learnt that Gambhir’s elevation to India’s head coach position had been in the works for months. It wouldn’t have mattered if KKR hadn’t won the IPL title. The head coach interview process was meant to be nothing but a formality. In any case, after BCCI secretary Jay Shah made it clear that India is not keen on having a foreigner as their head of the backroom staff, the interest among big names was anyway low.  </p>

            <p class="news">Retail prices in June soar to 5.08% after cooling to its lowest in a year</p>
            <p>India’s consumer inflation edged up to 5.08% in June from a year ago, after cooling to a 12-month low of 4.80% in May, driven by food prices, especially vegetables, data from the ministry of statistics and programme implementation showed on Friday.Food prices rose sharply to 9.36% in June, a jump from 8.69% in the previous month.

                Hot weather and heavy rain have pushed up prices of most groceries, especially tomatoes, potatoes and onions.
                
                Rabi or winter-sown onion output declined by 20% to 19 million tonnes this year. Rabi onion usually accounts for nearly 72% of India’s annual supply.
                
                “Food inflation is the main factor behind the grudgingly slow pace of disinflation. Recurring and overlapping supply-side shocks continue to play an outsized role in food inflation,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said in the minutes of the monetary policy committee meeting held in June.

                Bhubaneshwar: A little more than four and half decades after the Ratna Bhandar or the treasury of the Jagannath Temple was opened for audit and inventorisation, the storehouse of several valuables of the three deities would be opened on Sunday in the presence of members of the snake helpline and some doctors.
                
                The 16-member committee headed by retired high court judge Biswanath Rath that would supervise the inventorisation of the valuables inside the treasury is still working on the standard operating procedure of the opening process, but some members of the committee said the assistance of snake helpline officials would be sought when the Ratna Bhandar is opened.
